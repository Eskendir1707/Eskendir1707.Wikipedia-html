<h1> <b>HTML</b> </h1>
	<hr>
	<p><strong> The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as < img /> and < input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]</p>

<h3>Development</h3>
<div class="Wik"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Tim_Berners-Lee_April_2009.jpg/255px-Tim_Berners-Lee_April_2009.jpg"width="250" height="300"border="3"></div>
<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>


<p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]</p>

<p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

<p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]</p>

<p>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]</p>

<p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.[14]</p>


<h2>Browsers</h2>
<hr>
<p>Text documents containing HTML markup (such documents traditionally have the .html or .htm extension) are processed by special applications that display the document in its formatted form. Such applications, called "browsers" or "Internet browsers", usually provide a user-friendly interface for requesting web pages, viewing them (and displaying them on other external devices) and, if necessary, sending user-entered data to a server. The most popular browsers today are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer and Safari.</p>


<h2>Versions</h2>
<hr>
<ul><li>HTML 2.0 - Published by the IETF as RFC 1866 with Proposed Standard status (November 24, 1995) [7];</li></ul>
<ul><li>HTML 3.0 - March 28, 1995 - IETF Internet Draft (up to September 28, 1995)</li></ul>
<ul><li>HTML 3.2 [8] - January 14, 1997;</li></ul>
<ul><li>HTML 4.0 [9] - December 18, 1997;</li></ul>
<ul><li>HTML 4.01 [10] - December 24, 1999;</li></ul>
<ul><li>ISO / IEC 15445: 2000 [11] (so called ISO HTML, based on HTML 4.01 Strict) - May 15, 2000;</li></ul>
<ul><li>HTML5 [12] - October 28, 2014 [13];</li></ul>
<p>There is no official HTML 1.0 specification. Before 1995, there were many unofficial HTML standards. To make the standard version different from them, it was immediately assigned a second number.</p>

<p>Version 3 was proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in March 1995 and provided many new features, such as creating tables, "wrapping" images with text and displaying complex mathematical formulas, and support for the gif format. Even though this standard was compatible with the second version, its implementation was difficult for the browsers of the time. Version 3.1 was never officially offered, and the next version of the HTML standard was 3.2, which omitted many of the changes in version 3.0, but added non-standard elements supported by the Netscape Navigator and Mosaic browsers.</p>

<p>In HTML 4.0, there has been some cleanup of the standard. Many elements have been deprecated. In particular, the <font> tag used to change font properties has been deprecated (CSS style sheets are recommended instead).</p>

<p>In 1998, the World Wide Web Consortium began work on a new markup language based on HTML 4 but conforming to XML syntax. Subsequently, the new language was named XHTML. The first version of XHTML 1.0 was approved as a World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation on January 26, 2000.</p>

<p>The planned version of XHTML 2.0 was supposed to break compatibility with older versions of HTML and XHTML, but on July 2, 2009, the World Wide Web Consortium announced that the XHTML2 working group's mandate would expire at the end of 2009. Thus, all further development of the XHTML 2.0 standard was suspended [23].</p>

<h2>Perspectives</h2>
<hr>
<p>Currently, the World Wide Web Consortium has developed HTML version 5. A draft version of the language specification appeared on the Internet on November 20, 2007.</p>

<p>The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), since 2004 [24], has been developing the Web Applications 1.0 specification, often informally referred to as "HTML 5", which extends HTML (however, it also has an XHTML 1.0 compliant XML syntax ) to better represent the semantics of various typical pages, such as forums, auction sites, search engines, online stores, and so on, that do not fit well into the XHTML 2.0 model.</p>
